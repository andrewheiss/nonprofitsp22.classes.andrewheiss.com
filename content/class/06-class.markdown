## Written response question

Two parts for today:

1.  Write mission and vision statements for your team’s nonprofit project to propose to your team. You’ll spend class time narrowing down everyone’s proposals and consolidating and polishing everything into a single mission statement and vision statement.

2.  Write a possible mission and vision statement for John’s idea for the “I Choose to Live Foundation”
