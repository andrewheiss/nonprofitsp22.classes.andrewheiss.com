## Readings

- <i class="fas fa-book"></i> Chapter 9 in Grobman, *An Introduction to the Nonprofit Sector* [@Grobman:2021]
- <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i> Malaka Gharib, ["At What Point Does A Fundraising Ad Go Too Far?"](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2015/09/30/439162849/at-what-point-does-a-fundraising-ad-go-too-far)
- <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i> Abhishek Bhati, ["Many global charities refrain from ‘poverty porn’ imagery to raise money from donors, but stereotypes still distort their pictures"](https://theconversation.com/many-global-charities-refrain-from-poverty-porn-imagery-to-raise-money-from-donors-but-stereotypes-still-distort-their-pictures-171576)

This is a helpful checklist that you'll want to review when working on your project. I'd recommend skimming it before class, but you don't need to read it in detail:

- <i class="fas fa-file-pdf"></i> Chapter 9 in Peri H. Pakroo, *Starting & Building a Nonprofit* [@Pakroo:2021] (the PDF for this is on iCollege under "Content".)


## Written response question

Find an example of nonprofit advertising that engages in "poverty porn" and critique it. Why is the advertisement exploitative? What could the organization do to improve the campaign? (Answer in ≈150 words.)
