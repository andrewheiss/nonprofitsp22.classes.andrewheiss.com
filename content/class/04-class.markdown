## Written response question

Last week, I asked you to tell me what kind of social issue or type of nonprofit you’d be most interested in. In preparation for today’s team work, you’ll need to expand on that.

Think of a social issue or cause that you’d be interested in creating a nonprofit for. In ≈150 words, justify why (or why not) the issue should be addressed by the nonprofit sector. What kind of public goods would it provide? Why doesn’t the government or the private sector do it instead? (Think of the theory readings). Which IRS category would it fall under?

## Example charters

These are ***by no means*** ideal or perfect or anything. One is an ultra generic template; two are charters I dug up from my time as an MPA (master of public administration) student. But they’ll give you a good feel for what should be in a charter.
