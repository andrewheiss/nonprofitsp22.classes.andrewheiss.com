## Readings

-   <i class="fas fa-book"></i> Case 5, “Cutting the Budget of the Harristown Family Service,” in Grobman, *An Introduction to the Nonprofit Sector*[^1]

## Written response question

Two parts for today:

1.  Put together a basic, preliminary, balanced budget for your nonprofit to propose to your team. You’ll spend class time creating and finalizing your organization’s budget.

2.  Was it appropriate to have every staff member in the room to discuss strategies for closing the budget deficit? Could this situation have been handled differently? (Answer in ≈75 words.)
