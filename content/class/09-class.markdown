## Readings

-   <i class="fas fa-book"></i> Chapter 5 in Grobman, *An Introduction to the Nonprofit Sector*[^1]
-   <i class="fas fa-file-pdf"></i> Barbara E. Taylor, Richard P. Chait, and Thomas P. Holland, “The New Work of the Nonprofit Board”[^2] (you can [read this online here](https://hbr.org/1996/09/the-new-work-of-the-nonprofit-board); if you run into access issues, there’s a PDF of the article on iCollege under “Content”. *Do not buy this article—you can read it for free*)
-   <i class="fas fa-file-pdf"></i> Robert D. Herman and David O. Renz, “Board Practices of Especially Effective and Less Effective Local Nonprofit Organizations”[^3] (the PDF for this is on iCollege under “Content”.)

This is a helpful checklist that you’ll want to review when working on your project. I’d recommend skimming it before class, but you don’t need to read it in detail:

-   <i class="fas fa-file-pdf"></i> Chapter 4 in Peri H. Pakroo, *Starting & Building a Nonprofit*[^4] (the PDF for this is on iCollege under “Content”.)

## Written response question
